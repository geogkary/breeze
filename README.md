Use Breeze to quickly setup and start building JSON APIs with PHP. Breeze is a lightweight framework that takes care of versioning and routing, built on top of [mikecao/flight](https://github.com/mikecao/flight).

Requires PHP 5.6 or greater.

### Manually

Download [Breeze](https://github.com/geogkary/breeze/archive/master.zip) OR clone the repo in your project's root directory:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/geogkary/breeze.git
```

Download [Flight](https://github.com/mikecao/flight/archive/master.zip) OR clone the repo inside `engine/flight/`:

```cmd
cd engine/flight/
git clone https://github.com/mikecao/flight.git
```

Run Breeze:

```PHP
require 'engine/Breeze.php';
Breeze::init();
```

### Composer

composer require geogkary/breeze
```

```PHP
// autoload
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// manually
require 'vendor/geogkary/breeze/engine/composer.php';
```

## How to Start

1. Create a subdirectory `versions/` in your project's root directory
2. Download the [boilerplate API version](https://github.com/geogkary/breeze/archive/boilerplate.zip) to get started quickly
3. Edit `config.php` located in Breeze's root directory

## How to Configure

View the [docs](https://breezephp.com/docs) for more details.

#### Setting up routing:

Breeze is built on top of [Flight](https://github.com/mikecao/flight), which requires URL rewriting. Here's a quick .htaccess to copy:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
```

#### Using libraries:

If you're not using Composer, you can optionally load more libraries in the `engine/libraries/` directory.

#### Protecting your subdirectories:

Breeze provides the `endpointer.php` file, which serves a generic 404 response to requests. You can optionally require it in index.php files, to protect your API's subdirectories.
